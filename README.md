# Ticketing-Tool-Metro
This is a ticketing tool built using Django during my Metro BSC summer internship
## Features:
- 2 types of roles - `User`  and `Admin`
- Complete authentication is involved for users to signup and login to the system. 
- Based on the role different functionalities are implemented. 
- Forgot Password feature to reset password using mail.
- `Users` can raise a ticket,view edit and delete it.
- `Admins` can view all tickets, accept/reject them and they have an admin dashboard where all the information about tickets and different graphs are plotted.
